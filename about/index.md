Hello! My name is Nelio Carneiro Junior and I'm a brazilian software engineer
with more than 7 years of experience. Currently living in Warsaw, Poland. 

I'm graduated in Computer Science at 
[University Federal of Goias](http://www.ufg.br).

However, my history with computers has began a long time ago and I still remember it
clearly when was that.
The first time I saw a computer was with my father and he was playing Doom
(yeah! that epic game) and I admit I got more scared than curious about
it. It didn't catch my interest. At that time (around 1993) computers weren't 
that popular (at least not in Brazil).
But a litte bit later, when I was only 7 years old, something really got me.
I was at my friend's house and he asked me if I would like to play a game in his
computer. As I said yes, we went to the computer and after turn it on he started
to type some commands in a black screen and then the game just shown up. From that day
on I got a bit crazy about computers even though I earned my first computer
several years later than that.

In 2005 I started my college graduation in Computer Science and I got my
bachelor title in 2010.

At the same year I started my first job at Mara Turismo Hotel. It was
a marvelous first experience. I was the only developer there and the hotel
manager was a guy full of ideas. He really knew his business and were it could
improve. As much as I learnt about software development I learnt about business.
And it was great. Furthermore, the fact that I was the only developer there gave me
a lot of opportunities to try new things and build a lot by my own (and learn
with the many mistakes I used to make).
I worked a lot with PHP and Javascript/JQuery.
We created a software for [online booking](http://maraturismo.com.br/novo/en);
an internal ticket system for the day to day hotel issues; a mobile friendly
checklist application for room maids; a restaurant menu app for iPads and a lot
of small others.

In the middle of 2012 I moved to another city and started working at
[Martins](http://www.martinsdistribuidor.com.br), the biggest distributor
company in South America. I worked with the team responsible for the
development and maintence of all sales softwares. It was a good experience to
feel the pressure of making software that sells a few millions everyday. I worked
on a lot of projects during my 2 years and a half there.
The most important was the migration of the sales software for tablets 
(used to be on palm top pc's). The software was a hybrid native/html and we used
Java and Javascript/HTML (PhoneGAP).

At the beggining of 2015 I was invited to go to the ecommerce team - 
[eFacil](https://efacil.com.br). My new role was to help the marketing area to
achieve better results and also I was the responsible for the mobile
development through the mobile web version and apps. 

In the meantime I started a side project called [SuperFax](https://superfax.me) 
which is still alive. Is a Ruby on Rails web app to send faxes over the
internet as easy and simple as possible. 

I worked there until August of 2016 when I decided to move abroad. I went to
Ireland for sabatic period (Dublin was my choice and I tell more about
[here](https://medium.com/@neliojrr/h√°-10-meses-me-mudei-para-irlanda-ce53996884ef)).
After just one month there I received an offer to work as a full stack developer
at [GreenLetterbox](http://greenletterbox.com), position that I am until now.
Ended up that my role went more for the Frontend side which I'm fully responsible
right now. We make all the frontend with Javascript/ReactJS. We use PHP for
backend and we run some background jobs in golang.

I'm a really enthusiast of open source and I've been making some contributions.
Mainly Ruby projects.

I used to play acoustic guitar quite often and also basketball (I take it
serious though).

Because of my religion ([Espiritism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritism))
I've done volunteer jobs since I was a kid. This experience has been a big thing
in my life and has shaped my thinking towards helping others and on search for
self improvent. I talked more about it 
[here](https://medium.com/@neliojrr/o-trabalho-voluntario-esta-mudando-o-brasil-a800d5c9f292).
